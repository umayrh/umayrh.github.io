This post is collection of notes on Gilbert Simondon' book, 
[Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/individuation-in-light-of-notions-of-form-and).

## Introduction

Philosophy often focuses on existence and essence while individual beings only serve as
the apparent evidence of a different reality. Simondon, returning philosophy's focus to the process of
an individual's formation, says that what is implicit here is the assumption that there is a "principle of
individuation prior to individuation itself that is capable of explaining, producing, and guiding it." Perhaps
what makes his new focus unique is his refusal to "grant an ontological privilege to the constituted individual."
And so Simondon begins with two postulates:
* Individuation has a principle
* Individuation explains the individual, and not vice versa.

By page 2, Simondon deems philosophy - atomism and hylomorphism, in particular - to have inadequately
described individuation. By page 5, Simondon lays out what makes his thesis possible: "Individuation has not
been able to be adequately thought and described because only a single form of equilibrium was known, namely stable 
equilibrium; what was unknown was precisely metastable equilibrium." It is as if Simondon is announcing a 
new relationship of philosophy with natural sciences, physics and biology, in particular. And so Simondon folds
into philosophy concepts from thermodynamics like:
* system
* potential energy
* phase
* equilibrium (stable, metastable)

And, at least, in the first half of the book, his examples focus on:
* crystallization
* boiling and condensation
* rain, clouds, and snow

Though the phenomena also spans protein formation, semiconductor development, and alloy design. In other words,
nucleation pervades nature as well as technology.

"If...we supposed that individuation doesn't just produce the individual, we would not seek to pass quickly through
the stage of individuation to arrive at this ultimate reality that the individual is..." (pg. 3)

The principle of individuation is:
* Analytical: it is genesis - ontogenesis - in reverse,
* Explanatory: it accounts for an individual's _haecceity_: what makes an individual unique, 
* Primordial, in its operation:
  * "The individual...a relative reality... does not fully exist by itself"   
  * "...individuation does not fully exhaust in a single stroke the potentials of pre-individual reality" 

And so individuation can be redefined without reference to the individual: "a partial and relative resolution
that manifests in a system which contains potentials and includes a certain incompatibility with respect to itself, an
incompatibility that consists of forces of tension and the impossibility of an interaction between the extreme terms
of the dimensions." In other words, the essential aspect is not the coherence of the individual but the persistence of 
potentials in a system.

This lead to a redefinition of ontogenesis - not in terms of the constituted individual - but as a relationship 
of being and phase-shifting, a re-consideration of being, and a revaluation of the logic of being:
* "Becoming is a dimension of being, and corresponds to the being's capacity to phase shift"
* "Pre-individual being is being in which no phase exists"
* "Individuation corresponds to the appearance of phases in the being that are the phases of the being."
* "we must consider being not as substance or matter or form but as a tense, supersaturated system above the level of unity"
* "Unity, which is characteristic of the individual being, and identity, which authorizes the usage of the principle
  of the excluded middle, do not apply to pre-individual being"

#### Notes
##### Nucleation
- "In classic nucleation theory, a metastable disordered dense liquid or amorphous 
  solid cluster spontaneously and irreversibly transforms into a crystalline nucleus. 
  Jeon et al. observed the formation of gold crystals on a graphene substrate through 
  the reduction of a precursor using an electron beam. Rather than the classic view, 
  they instead observed a nucleation pathway that involves dynamic and reversible 
  fluctuations of developing nuclei between disordered and crystalline states." [1]
- "...organisms are able to control the location and crystallographic orientation of 
  nucleation, the shape of the growing crystallites, and even the phase of the 
  resulting material." [2]
- "How can the gas molecules “know” when they have to coagulate to form a liquid or solid?" [9]
- "If the expansion be slow, the supersaturation can nowhere greatly exceed that required for the 
  formation of the first drops.
  With very sudden expansions, however, even if they be much greater than
  that required to produce rain-like condensation, the drops which are the first to begin to form will 
  not have time to grow sensibly before the expansion is completed, and their influence on the temperature 
  and vapour contents of the air will be confined to a very small region round each." [8]
- "The key new idea [8,11] developed by BCF is that real solids are generally not perfectly
  crystalline, but contain dislocations, and in particular the intersection of a screw dislocation with
  a surface leads to the presence of a single molecular layer step (figure 2) that can never saturate; it
  allows growth of layers around the point of intersection of the dislocation and the surface without
  ever growing out of the crystal, like laying a carpet up a spiral staircase." [11]
- "The overwhelming majority of crystals growing from supercooled melts and supersaturated solutions are dendritic 
  (tree-like) structures that have a main trunk and side branches located at some distance from the vertex" [12]
- "it has become possible to explain the origin and selection of surface structures from planar to cellular, 
  dendritic, and fractal patterns. The Mullins–Sekerka (MS) morphological instability theory provides a condition 
  for stability or reconstruction of interfaces, which separates the phases during phase transformation." [13]
- "Fragmentation is a multistage process. (A) High-speed images show first fracture (Movie S1). A crack nucleates 
  and grows initially on a relatively slow millisecond timescale. Catastrophic failure occurs at a critical crack 
  depth (the Griffith length) leading to rapid crack propagation." [16]
- "According to classical nucleation theory, a nucleus from which crystals grow forms in a single, spontaneous step. 
  In this work, we combine ultralow-dose in situ liquid-phase and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy to show 
  that metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) nucleate through a different, nonclassical pathway with three distinct steps. 
  These steps are phase separation, condensation, and crystallization." [17]


##### Self-organization
- "...self-organization therefore typically occurs in non-equilibrium or dissipative systems. Cells, with their 
  constant energy consumption and myriads of local interactions between distinct proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and 
  nucleic acids, represent the perfect playground for self-organization. It therefore comes as no surprise that many 
  properties and features of self-organized systems, such as spontaneous formation of patterns, nonlinear coupling 
  of reactions, bi-stable switches, waves and oscillations, are found in all aspects of modern cell biology. 
  Ultimately, self-organization lies at the heart or the robustness and adaptability found in cellular and organismal 
  organization, and hence constitutes a fundamental basis for natural selection and evolution." [14]
- "A realization of the inability to equilibrate to a common structure (3, 4) and the ensemble nature of partially 
  folded forms led the theoretical community to a very different more statistical “new view” (7–11). It was 
  inferred that proteins must fold to their unique native state through multiple unpredictable routes and intermediate 
  conformations." [15]

##### Conception
- "The maternal–fetal interface (MFI) has long been considered an evolutionarily unresolved frontier of 
  genetic conflict owing to the genetic distinctness of the two sides of the interface. This unresolved 
  conflict has resulted in a diverse biological landscape of solutions" [pdf](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2323038122)
- "The instability at the origin of the universe is the result of fluctuations of the vacuum in which black holes 
  act as membranes that stabilize these fluctuations. In short, black holes will be produced by and “inverse” 
  Hawking radiation process and, once formed, will decompose into “real” matter through the usual Hawking radiation. 
  In this way, the irreversible transformation of space-time into matter can be described as a phase separation 
  between matter and gravitation in which black holes play the role of “critical nuclei.”" [18]
