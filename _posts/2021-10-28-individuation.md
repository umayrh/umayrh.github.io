This post is collection of notes on Gilbert Simondon' book, 
[Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/individuation-in-light-of-notions-of-form-and).

#### Notes
##### Nucleation
- "In classic nucleation theory, a metastable disordered dense liquid or amorphous 
  solid cluster spontaneously and irreversibly transforms into a crystalline nucleus. 
  Jeon et al. observed the formation of gold crystals on a graphene substrate through 
  the reduction of a precursor using an electron beam. Rather than the classic view, 
  they instead observed a nucleation pathway that involves dynamic and reversible 
  fluctuations of developing nuclei between disordered and crystalline states." [1]
- "...organisms are able to control the location and crystallographic orientation of 
  nucleation, the shape of the growing crystallites, and even the phase of the 
  resulting material." [2]
