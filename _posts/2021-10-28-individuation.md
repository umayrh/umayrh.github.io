This post is collection of notes on Gilbert Simondon' book, 
[Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/individuation-in-light-of-notions-of-form-and).

## Introduction

Philosophy often focuses on existence and essence while individual beings only serve as
the apparent evidence of a different reality. Simondon, returning philosophy's focus to the process of
an individual's formation, says that what is implicit here is the assumption that there is a "principle of
individuation prior to individuation itself that is capable of explaining, producing, and guiding it." Perhaps
what makes his new focus unique is his refusal to "grant an ontological privilege to the constituted individual."
And so Simondon begins with two postulates:
* Individuation has a principle
* Individuation explains the individual, and not vice versa.

By page 2, Simondon deems philosophy - atomism and hylomorphism, in particular - to have inadequately
described individuation. By page 5, Simondon lays out what makes his thesis possible: "Individuation has not
been able to be adequately thought and described because only a single form of equilibrium was known, namely stable 
equilibrium; what was unknown was precisely metastable equilibrium." It is as if Simondon is announcing a 
new relationship of philosophy with natural sciences, physics and biology, in particular. And so Simondon folds
into philosophy concepts from thermodynamics like:
* system
* potential energy
* phase
* equilibrium (stable, metastable)

And, at least, in the first half of the book, his examples focus on:
* crystallization
* boiling and condensation
* rain, clouds, and snow

Though the phenomena also spans protein formation, semiconductor development, and alloy design. In other words,
nucleation pervades nature as well as technology.

"If...we supposed that individuation doesn't just produce the individual, we would not seek to pass quickly through
the stage of individuation to arrive at this ultimate reality that the individual is..." (pg. 3)

The principle of individuation is:
* Analytical: it is genesis - ontogenesis - in reverse,
* Explanatory: it accounts for an individual's _haecceity_: what makes an individual unique, 
* Primordial, in its operation:
  * "The individual...a relative reality... does not fully exist by itself"   
  * "...individuation does not fully exhaust in a single stroke the potentials of pre-individual reality" 

And so individuation can be redefined without reference to the individual: "a partial and relative resolution
that manifests in a system which contains potentials and includes a certain incompatibility with respect to itself, an
incompatibility that consists of forces of tension and the impossibility of an interaction between the extreme terms
of the dimensions." In other words, the essential aspect is not the coherence of the individual but the persistence of 
potentials in a system.

This lead to a redefinition of ontogenesis - not in terms of the constituted individual - but as a relationship 
of being and phase-shifting, a re-consideration of being, and a revaluation of the logic of being:
* "Pre-individual being is being in which no phase exists"
* "Individuation corresponds to the appearance of phases in the being that are the phases of the being."

#### Notes
##### Nucleation
- "In classic nucleation theory, a metastable disordered dense liquid or amorphous 
  solid cluster spontaneously and irreversibly transforms into a crystalline nucleus. 
  Jeon et al. observed the formation of gold crystals on a graphene substrate through 
  the reduction of a precursor using an electron beam. Rather than the classic view, 
  they instead observed a nucleation pathway that involves dynamic and reversible 
  fluctuations of developing nuclei between disordered and crystalline states." [1]
- "...organisms are able to control the location and crystallographic orientation of 
  nucleation, the shape of the growing crystallites, and even the phase of the 
  resulting material." [2]

##### Conception
- "The maternal–fetal interface (MFI) has long been considered an evolutionarily unresolved frontier of 
  genetic conflict owing to the genetic distinctness of the two sides of the interface. This unresolved 
  conflict has resulted in a diverse biological landscape of solutions" [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2323038122)
