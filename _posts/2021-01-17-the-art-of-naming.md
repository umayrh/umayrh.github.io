I hope these running notes extract some problems in knowledge creation, recognition, and organization; and summarize 
insights from Michael Ohl's book, "The Art of Naming" (translated by E. Lauffer, published by MIT Press). Ohl is
a professor, and a biologist at the Natural History Museum of Berlin. 

## Prologue: The Beauty of Names 

* "Each one [creature] has a name, ... and it is through naming that it becomes part of our perception
of nature." Problem: How may changing nomenclature for natural beings indicate a change in "our" perception
of nature? 
* "A species name conveys authority and knowledge, structuring the living world according to science. A scientific
name is therefore a culminating point of a range of impressions, knowledge and interpretations."

## Hitler and the _Fledermaus_

* The German words for the shrew and the bat are _Spitzmaus_ and _Fledermaus_. These are both compound words
formed by joining *substantives*. The second element, "maus", is the *base* or the *determinatum* and "determines
both the denotation and the grammatical gender of the compound." The first element is the *determinative* or
*determinant*, which may be multiple words, more precisely qualifies the base. Example in English: mockingbird.
* The task of systematic biology: find invariants that can most reliably group related creature together.
  * Since appearance may be insufficient, use anatomical features of the skull and/or teeth. This has the
  added advantage of being able to incorporate fossils.
* "Groups of species are described as 'natural' when evidence exists of an ancestor common only to them; systems
of organisms comprised solely of such groups are designated in the same way. These stand in contrast to artificial
groups and artificial systems, in which the species' linkage is based on congruities that can be shown not to have
emerged from a unique evolutionary change in the most recent common ancestor." 
  - The classification of creatures, say from Aristotle to Linnaeus to current international organizations, have
  progressed from relying on animal behavior to anatomical dissection to anatomical imaging and now genetics.
* A taxonomic problem: "The arthropods, [spiders, insects, crabs] with their rigid exoskeleton and eponymous
multijointed appendages, are closely related to velvet worms and water bears, two groups of soft-skinned organisms
with simple, inarticulate legs that don't seem arthropodic in nature.
  - Campbell, L. I., Rota-Stabelli, O., Edgecombe, G. D., Marchioro, T., Longhorn, S. J., Telford, M., J., ... 
  Pisani, D. (2011). MicroRNAs and phylogenomics resolve the relationship of Tardigrada and suggest that velvet 
  worms are the sister group of Arthropoda. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. 108: 15920-15924.
  * [A new old animal](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/130905_newoldanimal) 
* Two possible solutions:
  * "Velvet worms and water bears are thrown in with the arthropods, thus expanding the semantic field of
  Arthropoda." Cost: the "old" arthropods will require a new name.
  * "The old arthropods stay arthropods but acquire a new superordinate name, along with the velvet worms and 
  the water bears."
  * The cost of updating knowledge (documentation, pedagogy) seems tacit here, and so remains unqualified. 
* Since the first solution was adopted by the systematic biology community, the new name was formed by
placing eu- (Greek prefix, indicating normal, typical, good, beautiful) in front of the old Arthropoda, hence
Euarthropoda. 
* How is knowledge organized and created?
  * International Code of Zoological Nomenclature documents the rules of naming.
  * International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature edits the rules.
* Some important classical texts in naming:
  * Friedrich Kluge. Etymological Lexicon of the German Language.
  * Helmut Carl. German Plant and Animal Names: Explanation and Linguistic Order.
  * Hugo Palander. Old High German Animal Names, Volume 1: The Names of Mammals. 1899.
  * Hugo Suolhati. German Bird Names: A Linguistic Study. 1909.
  * Theodore of Canterbury. Leviticus Apostils. ~700. 
* An example of etymology:
  * _Pferd_, horse -> _pfarifit_ (Old High German) -> _pferfrit_, _pharit_, _pfert_ (Middle High German) ...
  -> _paraveredus_ (Medieval Latin) ... -> _gorwydd_ (Welsh) -> _reda_ (Celtic)
* How were the linguistic creations reached for the animal names in use today?
  * Onomatopoeia: "the mimicry of sounds plays the biggest role in the animal names that have arisen this way."
    * Examples: cuckoo, chickadee, towhee, bobwhite, bobolink, whip-poor-will, Chuck-will's-widow.
    * "_Mowe_ (seagull) is believed to be derived from the Middle High German verb _mawen_ and the
    Modern Dutch _mauwen_, both of which signify the meowing of a cat, meaning that an onomatopoeic
    term has been transferred from one animal to another."
  * Loanwords: brought from an animal's place of origin into English
    * Examples: axolotl (Mexico), jaguar (South American indigenous), jackal (India), impala (Zulu),
    iguana (Arawak), salamander (Persian), cassowary (kasuari: Malay).
  * Recombining old words: "base word is qualified through the inclusion of certain features, such as
    geographical origin or special physical traits."  
    * Examples: Kompassqualle, Wasserspitmaus, Australian snubfin dolphon, Burrunan dolphin. 
* Example of folk etymology or reanalysis:
  *  _crevise_ (Old French) -> _ecrevisse_ (Modern French) -> crayfish (English) -> craw(l)fish (Louisiana)
* Some important modern texts in naming:
  * National Audobon Society Field Guides.
  * Bernhard Grzimek. Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. 1967.
  * Mammals of Africa.
  * Birds of the World: Recommended English Names. 2006.
  * A Thesaurus of Bird Names: Etymology of European Lexis Through Paradigms. 1998.
* Grzimek's three important linguistic directives for popular presentation of scientific content:
  * Foreign or technical expressions are to be avoided, or at least reworded using more familiar terms.
  * Words that may carry a negative or pejorative connotation are to be replaced with corresponding terms
    used for humans.
  * All the vertebrates, at least, are to have a vernacular name.
* The creation of common names for mammals is not governed by any central rulebooks, and so adoption
  may vary. Birds are an exception since there's been literature on birds since antiquity, and 
  ornithologists - amateur or not - are well-organized. E.g. the Standing Committee on English Names is
  responsible for the official list of English bird names. The International Ornithological Congress (IOC)
  provides a regularly updated catalog of standard English names on www.worldbirdnames.org
* Other branches of science face similar issues. From 
  [Opinion: Standardizing gene product nomenclatureâ€”a call to action](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2025207118?etoc=):
  * The prevalence of function, appearance, and place (locale/geography) in naming: "However, 
  current protein naming systems based on different aspects of structure, 
  function, and cellular localization readily conflict, and they may make less sense if new 
  functions, alternative structures, or novel cellular localizations are discovered."
  * The organization of discourse: "Steps to implement an advanced gene product nomenclature system: 
  (i) form a working group consisting of experts from diverse fields, (ii) develop a standardized 
  nomenclature system and usage guidelines, (iii) implement the system, (iv) receive feedback, 
  and (v) improve the standardized nomenclature system and usage guidelines."
