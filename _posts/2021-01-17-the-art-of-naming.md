I hope these running notes extract some problems in knowledge creation, recognition, and organization; and summarize 
insights from Michael Ohl's book, "The Art of Naming" (translated by E. Lauffer, published by MIT Press). Ohl is
a professor, and a biologist at the Natural History Museum of Berlin. 

## Prologue: The Beauty of Names 

* "Each one [creature] has a name, ... and it is through naming that it becomes part of our perception
of nature." Problem: How may changing nomenclature for natural beings indicate a change in "our" perception
of nature? 
* "A species name conveys authority and knowledge, structuring the living world according to science. A scientific
name is therefore a culminating point of a range of impressions, knowledge and interpretations."

## Hitler and the _Fledermaus_

* The German words for the shrew and the bat are _Spitzmaus_ and _Fledermaus_. These are both compound words
formed by joining *substantives*. The second element, "maus", is the *base* or the *determinatum* and "determines
both the denotation and the grammatical gender of the compound." The first element is the *determinative* or
*determinant*, which may be multiple words, more precisely qualifies the base. Example in English: mockingbird.
* The task of systematic biology: find invariants that can most reliably group related creature together.
  * Since appearance may be insufficient, use anatomical features of the skull and/or teeth. This has the
  added advantage of being able to incorporate fossils.
* "Groups of species are described as 'natural' when evidence exists of an ancestor common only to them; systems
of organisms comprised solely of such groups are designated in the same way. These stand in contrast to artificial
groups and artificial systems, in which the species' linkage is based on congruities that can be shown not to have
emerged from a unique evolutionary change in the most recent common ancestor." 
  - The classification of creatures, say from Aristotle to Linnaeus to current international organizations, have
  progressed from relying on animal behavior to anatomical dissection to anatomical imaging and now genetics.
* A taxonomic problem: "The arthropods, [spiders, insects, crabs] with their rigid exoskeleton and eponymous
multijointed appendages, are closely related to velvet worms and water bears, two groups of soft-skinned organisms
with simple, inarticulate legs that don't seem arthropodic in nature.
  - Campbell, L. I., Rota-Stabelli, O., Edgecombe, G. D., Marchioro, T., Longhorn, S. J., Telford, M., J., ... 
  Pisani, D. (2011). MicroRNAs and phylogenomics resolve the relationship of Tardigrada and suggest that velvet 
  worms are the sister group of Arthropoda. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. 108: 15920-15924.
  * [A new old animal](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/130905_newoldanimal) 
* Two possible solutions:
  * "Velvet worms and water bears are thrown in with the arthropods, thus expanding the semantic field of
  Arthropoda." Cost: the "old" arthropods will require a new name.
  * "The old arthropods stay arthropods but acquire a new superordinate name, along with the velvet worms and 
  the water bears."
  * The cost of updating knowledge (documentation, pedagogy) seems tacit here, and so remains unqualified. 
* Since the first solution was adopted by the systematic biology community, the new name was formed by
placing eu- (Greek prefix, indicating normal, typical, good, beautiful) in front of the old Arthropoda, hence
Euarthropoda. 
* How is knowledge organized and created?
  * International Code of Zoological Nomenclature documents the rules of naming.
  * International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature edits the rules.
* Some important classical texts in naming:
  * Friedrich Kluge. Etymological Lexicon of the German Language.
  * Helmut Carl. German Plant and Animal Names: Explanation and Linguistic Order.
  * Hugo Palander. Old High German Animal Names, Volume 1: The Names of Mammals. 1899.
  * Hugo Suolhati. German Bird Names: A Linguistic Study. 1909.
  * Theodore of Canterbury. Leviticus Apostils. ~700. 
* An example of etymology:
  * _Pferd_, horse -> _pfarifit_ (Old High German) -> _pferfrit_, _pharit_, _pfert_ (Middle High German) ...
  -> _paraveredus_ (Medieval Latin) ... -> _gorwydd_ (Welsh) -> _reda_ (Celtic)
* How were the linguistic creations reached for the animal names in use today?
  * Onomatopoeia: "the mimicry of sounds plays the biggest role in the animal names that have arisen this way."
    * Examples: cuckoo, chickadee, towhee, bobwhite, bobolink, whip-poor-will, Chuck-will's-widow.
    * "_Mowe_ (seagull) is believed to be derived from the Middle High German verb _mawen_ and the
    Modern Dutch _mauwen_, both of which signify the meowing of a cat, meaning that an onomatopoeic
    term has been transferred from one animal to another."
  * Loanwords: brought from an animal's place of origin into English
    * Examples: axolotl (Mexico), jaguar (South American indigenous), jackal (India), impala (Zulu),
    iguana (Arawak), salamander (Persian), cassowary (kasuari: Malay).
  * Recombining old words: "base word is qualified through the inclusion of certain features, such as
    geographical origin or special physical traits."  
    * Examples: Kompassqualle, Wasserspitmaus, Australian snubfin dolphon, Burrunan dolphin. 
* Example of folk etymology or reanalysis:
  *  _crevise_ (Old French) -> _ecrevisse_ (Modern French) -> crayfish (English) -> craw(l)fish (Louisiana)
* Some important modern texts in naming:
  * National Audobon Society Field Guides.
  * Bernhard Grzimek. Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. 1967.
  * Mammals of Africa.
  * Birds of the World: Recommended English Names. 2006.
  * A Thesaurus of Bird Names: Etymology of European Lexis Through Paradigms. 1998.
* Grzimek's three important linguistic directives for popular presentation of scientific content:
  * Foreign or technical expressions are to be avoided, or at least reworded using more familiar terms.
  * Words that may carry a negative or pejorative connotation are to be replaced with corresponding terms
    used for humans.
  * All the vertebrates, at least, are to have a vernacular name.
* The creation of common names for mammals is not governed by any central rulebooks, and so adoption
  may vary. Birds are an exception since there's been literature on birds since antiquity, and 
  ornithologists - amateur or not - are well-organized. E.g. the Standing Committee on English Names is
  responsible for the official list of English bird names. The International Ornithological Congress (IOC)
  provides a regularly updated catalog of standard English names on www.worldbirdnames.org
* The issue of nomenclature governance became prominent recently [[4]](#ref4), leading to the publication of 
  "Principles for creating a single authoritative list of the world’s species" [[5]](#ref5). The opinion
  paper uses the following figure to describe the existing process for gathering taxonomic information,
  and highlight the challenges of decentralized information aggregation. "Thus, whilst there is 
  already a high degree of collaboration among aggregators, with much sharing of lists (Fig 1), 
  all the aggregators remain distinct entities. This results in differences among the lists they 
  propagate, not least because they are updated at different rates. Added to this are the 
  complications that arise when taxonomic groups have multiple authoritative lists." 
  The principles are:
  * the species list must be based on science and free from nontaxonomic considerations and interference, 
  * governance of the species list must aim for community support and use, 
  * all decisions about list composition must be transparent, 
  * the governance of validated lists of species is separate from the governance of the names of taxa, 
  * governance of lists of accepted species must not constrain academic freedom, 
  * the set of criteria considered sufficient to recognise species boundaries may appropriately 
     vary between different taxonomic groups but should be consistent when possible, 
  * a global list must balance conflicting needs for currency and stability by having archived versions, 
  * contributors need appropriate recognition, 
  * list content should be traceable, and 
  * a global listing process needs both to encompass global diversity and to accommodate local knowledge of that diversity. 
  ![Fig. 1](/assets/images/art-of-naming-fig-2.png)
* Other branches of science face similar issues. From [[7]](#ref7):
  * The prevalence of function, appearance, and place (locale/geography) in naming: "However, 
  current protein naming systems based on different aspects of structure, 
  function, and cellular localization readily conflict, and they may make less sense if new 
  functions, alternative structures, or novel cellular localizations are discovered."
  * The organization of discourse: "Steps to implement an advanced gene product nomenclature system: 
    * form a working group consisting of experts from diverse fields,
    * develop a standardized nomenclature system and usage guidelines, 
    * implement the system, 
    * receive feedback, and 
    * improve the standardized nomenclature system and usage guidelines."

## How Species Get Their Names
* Two constraints for new species: correctness of genus, uniqueness of species. Three ways to achieve this:
  * Scour taxonomic literature for similar creatures e.g. Biodiversity Heritage Library,
  * Examine the "type specimen", i.e. individual creatures that serve(d) as basis for species name,
    * The individual type specimen is also called the "holotype"; others, "paratype" 
  * Examine the "unidentified material" to be able to discern between intra- and inter-species variability.
* Name availability and validity:
  * The name must use the Latin alphabet though the description may be in any language and script.
  * The name should be traceable to a specific language.
  * The name must be a binomial, and the generic and species name must both have at least two characters.
* "A species name usually falls into one of the following word groups:
  * An adjective or participle in the nominative singular case. Most species name belong to this
    group: _Echinus esculentus_, the edible sea urchin, and the _Somatochlora metallica_, the brilliant
    emerald, a dragonfly.
  * A noun in the nominative singular case that is in apposition to the genus name: _Cercopithecus diana_,
    or Diana monkey.
  * A noun in the genitive case: _Myotis daubentonii_, Daubenton's bat, and _Diplolepis rosae_, the
    rose bedeguar gall."
* Books on name composition:
  * F. C. Werner. Wortelemente lateinisch-griechischer Fachausdrücke in den biologischen Wissenschaften. 1968.
  * F. C. Werner. Die Benennung der Organismen und Organe nach Größe, Form, Farbe und anderen Merkmalen. 1970.
  * R. W. Brown. Composition of Scientific Words. 1927.
  * International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. [The Code](https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/).
* Principle of priority: "A taxon's oldest name is always the valid one."
  * Synonymy: different name gives to the same taxon
    * Subjective synonymy: different descriptions exist for the same taxon because of different opinions
    * Objective synonymy: "two different descriptions exist for the same source material."  
  * Homonymy: same name for different species
    * Primary homonymy: "a name that was originally described in a genus that already contained the given species name."
    * Secondary homonymy: "the species in question is later moved into a different genus that it was originally ascribed." 
  * Example: 
    * _Crabro sabulosus_, (J. C. Fabricius, 1787) was suggested be moved to genus _Spex_ but _Sphex sabulosus_ was taken.
    * Two secondary homonyms suggested: _Sphex ruficornis_ (1789) and _Sphex crabronea_ (1791).
    * Turns out that it actually belongs to the genus _Mellinus_, so _Mellinus sabulosus_?
    * The Code through proscribes junior homonyms introduced before 1961, so no sabulosus.
    * Next in line of succession is _Sphex ruficornis_: also a junior primary homonym.
    * Next after is _Sphex crabronea_, which after genus and grammatical-gender correction, became 
      _Mellinus craboneus_ (Thunberg, 1791).
      * Note that the two constraints - priority, and preservation of name-author association - in
        this case led of the erasure of the name of the discoverer.

## Words, Proper Names, Individuals
* What are the functions of species name?
  * Help make scientific communication - data, results, interpretations - clearer.
* Proper names vs appellatives (common nouns):
  * "It is ... expected that each zoological name will refer unambiguously and unmistakeably to
  exactly one taxon - that is, one named group of animals such as species."
  * "[N]ames perform their referential function immediately - that is, directly and without a 'detour'
  through semantic meaning... Appellatives help make reference, not to a single thing, but to a 
  whole class of things."
  * "In this one-to-one relationship between name and object, proper names differ fundamentally
  from appellatives, which refer to a class of objects."
  * Interesting example: _Tamias minimus_ is a proper name but "least chipmunk" is an appellative
  though they refer to the same object. Since the object is necessarily a class of specific
  individuals, it makes more sense to say that species, though a class, function as individuals
  in biological nomenclature i.e. taxons, as classes, are composed of species, and species are a
  fundamental unit.
* Do species as classes have real or nominal existence?
  * Reproductive isolation, or barriers, foster consistent similarities and differences between
  individual bound together by sexual procreation. (Ernst Mayr).
    * How can this be extended to organisms that procreate through "budding" (like polyps) or
    parthogenesis (like walking sticks)?
  * "One important quality of a class is also its consistency, which can be attributed to the
  fact that a specific, unalterable quality - ... essense - is unique to it."
  * Typological species concept: "The notion of species as classes with constant, class-specific
  qualities represents a monumental contradiction to the notion of a dynamic evolutionary
  process and changing species."
    * "Contradiction" seems exaggerated, since it is clearly possible to evolve and yet possess
    similarities and differences that may be consistent over some period of time.
    * Michael T. Ghiselin. A Radical Solution to the Species Problem. 1974.
  * To be an individual, a "thing", species should be:
    * Spatially and temporally locatable
      * "The discontinuity of an 'individual' that exists in areas distant from one another
      definitely poses a problem..."
    * Accessible to the senses
      * Not directly really, until unless it's the last individual of a species.
    * Be "particular", and "change"
      * Species are particular, and change while remaining the same species (anagenesis). 
    * Have contingent existence
      * Species, as products of evolution, don't have a necessary existence.
  * "[S]pecies naming is 'biologically neutral'":
    * Nomenclature, organization of names and naming, is distinct from taxonomy, the codification
    of biological entities.
    * "The objects of the Code are to promote stability and universality in the scientific
    names of animals and to ensure that the name of each taxon is unique and distinct. All its
    provisions and recommendations are subservient to those ends and none restricts the
    freedom of taxonomic though or actions."
* It may not be obvious, but humans programming computers to human names habitually make assumptions
  about naming conventions, which are often untrue. Some examples for such assumptions from [[11]](#ref11),
  which also indicate the problems that formality of The Code tries to circumvent:
  * People have exactly one canonical full name.
  * People have exactly one full name which they go by.
  * People have, at this point in time, exactly one canonical full name.
  * People’s first names and last names are, by necessity, different.
  * People have last names, family names, or anything else which is shared by folks recognized as their relatives.
  * People’s names are almost globally unique.
  * People’s names are assigned at birth.
  * Two different systems containing data about the same person will use the same name for that person.
  * People have names.
