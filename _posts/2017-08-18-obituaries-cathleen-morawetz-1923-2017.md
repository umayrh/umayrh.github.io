In the mathematics of flows and shocks, [Cathleen Morawetz](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/obituary-cathleen-morawetz), 
[Olga Ladyzhenskaya](http://www.ams.org/notices/200411/fea-olga.pdf), and Olga Oleinik together form a singular legacy, 
an interconnected legacy ([Early Memories of Olga Ladyzhenskaya and Olga Oleinik](http://topo.math.auburn.edu/pub/2Olgas-proceedings/pa003-morawetz.pdf)). 
One senses a process and procedure of inheritance indifferent to the act of birth 
([Women in Mathematics: The Legacy of Ladyzhenskaya and Oleinik](http://topo.math.auburn.edu/pub/2Olgas-proceedings/)). 

“Of course, many discoveries have something of an accident about them,” 
[said](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/science_lives_video/cathleen-morawetz/) Morawetz. And, perhaps, Hölderlin would have 
responded: "By that mysterious yearning toward the chasm; / Chaotic deeps attract, and whole peoples too"
