> Kuhn enrolled at Princeton in the fall of 1947. He wrote his doctoral dissertation in group theory under the direction of Ralph Fox. Concurrently, he joined mathematics professor A.W. Tucker and fellow graduate student David Gale in a hastily organized summer project to study the suspected equivalence between linear programming and matrix game theory. That project, he later wrote, “set the course of my subsequent academic career, which has centered around the applications of mathematics to economics.” In 1980, the three shared the John von Neumann Theory Prize of the Operations Research Society of America (now part of INFORMS) for their pioneering work in game theory and optimization.
