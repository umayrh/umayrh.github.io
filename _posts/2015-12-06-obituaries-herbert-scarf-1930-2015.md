The four breakthroughs:

1. Computation of equilibria (Scarf algorithm)
2. Production sets with indivisibilities
3. Core allocation existence and computation
4. Equivalence of core allocation and competitive equilibrium allocation (Debreu-Scarf Theorem, Edgeworth's conjecture)

"Fixed Point Theorems and Economic Equilibrium" at "The Economics of Kenneth J. Arrow," The Institute for 
Advanced Studies, The Hebrew University, June 30, 2008:
