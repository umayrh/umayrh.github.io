Metaphor implies repetition with a difference. A catalog might then also be an extended metaphor. This post 
is an open-ended, self-organizing catalog of catalogs, categories, associations, and tropes.

#### Seven Types of Ambiguity

![Reification of Properties](/assets/images/reification-of-properties.png)

* Type 1: a detail effective in several ways at once
* Type 2: two or more alternative meanings resolve into one
* Type 3: two apparently unconnected meanings are given simultaneously
* Type 4: alternative meanings combine to make clear a complicated state of mind in the author
* Type 5: a fortunate confusion
* Type 6: what is said is contradictory or irrelevant  and the reader is forced to invent interpretations  
* Type 7: full contradiction, marking a division in the author's mind

(W. Empson, 1949.)
#### Catalog of Aspirations

A [review](https://qz.com/1451836/saying-the-internet-is-broken-wont-fix-anything/) of David Clark's book, Designing an Internet,
mentions his Catalog of Aspirations. This manifold of metrics first appears in his 2015 paper with kc claffy, 
[An Inventory of Aspirations for the Internet’s future](https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2015/inventory_aspirations_internets_future/inventory_aspirations_internets_future.pdf).

![Aspirations](/assets/images/aspiration-interaction.png)

The 17th, Global doesn't appear in the original list. Composition has always been a theme in Internet 
design, even as it moves from layers with distinct networking [constraints](http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf) 
to layers that are [self-contained networks](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos561/papers/Composition18.pdf). 
And yet: 
* Are [utility maximization](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/archive/help/uploads/wiki/files/187/layering.pdf) 
and simplicity of network management the organizing principles of layering? If [virtual network embedding](http://csr.bu.edu/rina/papers/VINEA2016.pdf)  
becomes a dynamic problem, a network utility function can capture the quality and constraints of embedding.
* Is it that the end-to-end principle has been so successful that it repeated itself - as self-contained, 
independent networks - and defied the globalization of any specific instance of the concept? 
* Under what conditions would a particular instance of the end-to-end principle maximize ubiquity? A 
strategic game or evolutionary selection mechanism? 

#### Creative, Interactive, Communication

J. C. R. Licklider and R. Taylor's 1968 paper, [The Computer as a Communication Device](https://signallake.com/innovation/LickliderApr68.pdf) combines
elements of a manifesto, a sci-fi short story, and a user manual:

* "Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that can be modeled..."
* "access both to informational resources and to the processes for making use of the resources"
* "When mental models are dissimilar, the achievement of communication might be signaled by changes in the structure of one of the models, or both of them"
* "Interactive communication consists of short spurts of dialog"
* "dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, catalogues, editing programs, teaching programs, testing 
  programs, programming systems, data bases, and—most important—communication, display, and modeling programs"
* "an infinite crescendo of on-line interactive debugging"

#### The Complex, The Changing and the Indeterminate

![Total Filing](/assets/images/total-filing.png)

T. H. Nelson in [A File Structure for The Complex, The Changing and the Indeterminate](https://signallake.com/innovation/FileStructure65.pdf):
* "capacity for intricate and idiosyncratic arrangements, total modifiability, undecided alternatives, and thorough internal documentation"
* "acts like a multifarious, polymorphic, many-dimensional, infinite blackboard"
* "card file, notebook, index tabs, edge-punching, file folders, scissors and paste, graphic boards, index-strip frames, Xerox machine and the roll-top desk"
* "many revision processes before they are finished. Intellectually they are pondered juxtaposed, compared, adapted, transposed, and judged; mechanically 
  they are copied, overwritten with revision markings, rearranged and copied again"
* "different categories of personal notes, separate drafts, outlines and master indices"
* "niggling complications, hidden passageways, and lurking, detailed interlocks, restrictions, specializations, provisos"
* "The ELF has three elements: entries, lists and links. An _entry_ is a discrete unit of information designated by 
  the user. A _list_ is an ordered set of entries designated by the user. A given entry may be in any number of 
  lists. A _link_ is a connector, designated by the user, between two particular entries which are in different 
  lists... An entry in one list may be linked to only one entry in another list."
* "historical trails or associative (Bush) trails through documents, business correspondence, belles-lettres, case law, 
  treaties, scholarly fields and history, and the mixture of trail with categorical filing"
* "rectangular arrays, lattices and more intricate configurations"
* "stored, displayed, taken apart for examination, and corrected, updated, or modified"
* "outline, suboutline, draft, subdraft, summary, commentary and source list"
* "incorporating Folios, bowdlerizations, satires and all critical commentary"
* "interrelations of possibilities, consequences, and strategic options"
* "Let me introduce the word "hypertext" to mean a body of written or pictorial material interconnected 
  in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper."

#### A Palette of Systems Thinking Tools

![Systems Archetypes](/assets/images/system-arch.png)

Daniel Kim, in [System Archetypes 1](https://thesystemsthinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Systems-Archetypes-I-TRSA01_pk.pdf), 
somewhat effortlessly combines self-help, managerial/organizational psychology, and cybernetics: 

* "There are at least 10 distinct types of systems thinking tools ... They fall under four broad categories: 
  brainstorming tools, dynamic thinking tools, structural thinking tools, and computer-based tools."
* "The Double-Q (QQ) Diagram is based on what is commonly known as a fish- bone or cause-and-effect diagram"
* "Behavior Over Time (BOT) Diagrams are more than simple line projections— they capture the dynamic relationships among variables."
* "Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) provide a useful way to represent dynamic interrelationships"
* "System Archetypes is the name given to certain common dynamics that seem to recur in many different settings."
* "Graphical Function Diagrams, Structure-Behavior Pairs, and Policy Structure Diagrams can be viewed as the building blocks for computer models."

#### Peirce’s Recursive Trichotomies 

![Peirce-signs](/assets/images/Ten-classes-of-signs.png)

C. S. Perice reminds me of Leibniz though Peirce's monadology is trivalent semiotics. T. Nellhaus discusses the 
self-branching process of Perice's categories in an interesting [post](http://tobinnellhaus.com/2018/09/peirces-recursive-trichotomies/#Note%201):
 
* "'the map itself will be portrayed in the map, and in this map of the map everything on the soil of the 
  country can be discerned, including the map itself with the map of the map within its boundary. Thus there 
  will be within the map a map of the map, and within that a map of the map of the map and so on ad infinitum'. 
  (EP 2.162)"
* "Peirce next applies the concepts of the categories and their degenerate forms to semiotics, tying Firstness 
  to icons, Secondness to indexes, and Thirdness to symbols, and then elaborating on the iconic element of 
  indexes and the iconic and indexical elements of symbols. He adds, significantly, that “The Symbol, or 
  relatively genuine form of Representamen, divides by trichotomy into the Term, the Proposition, and 
  the Argument” (EP 2.164)."
* "in “Nomenclature and Divisions of Triadic Relations, as Far as They Are Determined,” he presented the theory 
  that there are three trichotomies: (1) Qualisigns, Sinsigns, and Legisigns; (2) Icons, Indexes, and Symbols; 
  and (3) Rhemes, Dicents, and Arguments."
* "If three recursions leads to ten classes of signs, then three recursions of three recursions, for a total of 
  ten recursions (hence ten trichotomies) would mean there are 66 types of signs—which was his claim (EP 2.481)."
* "'the six trichotomies, instead of determining 729 classes of signs, as they would if they were independent, 
  only yield 28 classes; and if, as I strongly opine (not to say almost prove) there are four other trichotomies 
  of signs of the same order of importance, instead of making 59,049 classes, these will only come to 66.' (EP 2.481)"

#### The Seven Tools of Causal Inference.

![Causal Questions](/assets/images/causal-questions.png)

Judea Pearl's [paper](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf) establishes a causal hierarchy (association, 
intervention, counterfactual), and outlines seven tasks accomplished by the Structural Causal Models (composed of 
graphical models, structural equations, and a couterfactual and interventional calculus):
  * Encoding Causal Assumptions – Transparency and Testability
  * Do-calculus and the control of confounding 
  * The Algorithmization of Counterfactuals 
  * Mediation Analysis and the Assessment of Direct and Indirect Effects 
  * Adaptability, External Validity and Sample Selection Bias
  * Recovering from Missing Data
  * Causal Discovery

#### Performance, Observation, Methodology

![Observability](/assets/images/linux_observability_tools.png)

In laying out his argument for [Performance Analysis Methodology](http://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html), Brendan 
Gregg calls for understanding system behavior more efficiently by mapping out the architecture of a system, tagging 
substructures with observational tools, and relating observations using architectural constraints.
