#### Bandits with concave rewards and convex knapsacks.
[Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5758v1.pdf) by Shipra Agrawal and Nikhil R. Devanur.
Introduces and gives polynomial-time near-optimal algorithms for a general model for bandit exploration-exploitation. 
The algorithm is an extension of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for the multi-armed bandits problem. The new 
framework allows them to give more efficient algorithms for other problems such as Blackwell approachability, online 
convex optimization and conditional-gradient/projection-free/Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

#### Managing congestion in decentralized matching markets,
[Paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427960) by Nick Arnosti, Ramesh Johari and Yash Kanoria.
Shows that in decentralized two-sided markets with asynchronous arrivals and departures and no information about seller 
availability, limited seller visibility can improve general welfare.

#### Optimising Trade-offs Among Stakeholders in Ad Auctions
[Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5127v1.pdf) by Yoram Bachrach, Sofia Ceppi, Ian Kash, Peter Key and David Kurokaw.
Optimizes linear combinations of the utilities of competing stakeholders (auctioneer, user, advertiser) in ad auctions 
using a generalized second-price (GSP) auction with per-click reserve prices.

#### Multiplicative Bidding in Online Advertising
[Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6727v1.pdf) by MohammadHossein Bateni, Jon Feldman, Vahab Mirrokni and Sam Chiu-wai Wong.
Establishes the optimization problem behind multiplicative bidding, a bid adjustment technique used by many search engines. 
They also study the complexity of approximating the solution and give algorithms under various assumptions.

#### Why Marketplace Experimentation is Harder than it Seems: The Role of Test-Control Interference
[Paper](http://www.scu.edu/business/economics/upload/YellowPad-TomBlake.pdf) by Dominic Coey and Thomas Blake.
Discusses role of and conditions for test-control (A/B) interference in determining the effectiveness of marketplace campaigns

#### Incentivized Optimal Advert Assignment via Utility Decomposition,
[Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2750v2.pdf) by Frank Kelly, Peter Key and Neil Walton.
Kelly extends his primal-dual optimization framework (originally introduced for communication networks) to formulate a 
network utility maximization framework for platform and advertisers together. The mechanism introduced is also incentive 
compatible.

#### The Complexity of Fairness through Equilibrium,
[Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6249v2.pdf) by Abraham Othman, Christos Papadimitriou and Aviad Rubinstein.
Discusses the complexity of approximating Competitive Equilibrium with Equal Income (CEEI, a particular market clearing 
mechanism that offers efficiency, feasibility and fairness. In short, approximating CEEI in general is hard.

#### Asymptotically Truthful Equilibrium Selection in Large Congestion Games,
[Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2625v1.pdf) by Ryan Rogers and Aaron Roth.
For congestion games with large number of players and incomplete information, this paper introduces mechanism that 
guarantees a Nash equilibrium improving on previous mechanisms that could only guarantee correlated equilibrium.

#### Neutrality and Geometry of Mean Voting
[Paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nkshah/papers/euclidean_voting.ec14.pdf) by Sébastien Lahaie and Nisarg Shah.
Integrates the neutrality axiom into mean proximity framework for voting to achieve consensus amongst agents, 
and shows that the new axiom allows a more compact representation for every mean proximity rule.
