\[[1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5758v1.pdf)\] **Bandits with concave rewards and convex knapsacks,** Shipra Agrawal and Nikhil R. Devanur

Introduces and gives polynomial-time near-optimal algorithms for a general model for bandit exploration-exploitation. The algorithm is an extension of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for the multi-armed bandits problem. The new framework allows them to give more efficient algorithms for other problems such as Blackwell approachability, online convex optimization and conditional-gradient/projection-free/Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

\[[2](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427960)\] **Managing congestion in decentralized matching markets,** Nick Arnosti, Ramesh Johari and Yash Kanoria

Shows that in decentralized two-sided markets with asynchronous arrivals and departures and no information about seller availability, limited seller visibility can improve general welfare.

\[[3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5127v1.pdf)\] **Optimising Trade-offs Among Stakeholders in Ad Auctions,** Yoram Bachrach, Sofia Ceppi, Ian Kash, Peter Key and David Kurokaw

Optimizes linear combinations of the utilities of competing stakeholders (auctioneer, user, advertiser) in ad auctions using a generalized second-price (GSP) auction with per-click reserve prices.

\[[4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6727v1.pdf)\] **Multiplicative Bidding in Online Advertising,** MohammadHossein Bateni, Jon Feldman, Vahab Mirrokni and Sam Chiu-wai Wong

Establishes the optimization problem behind multiplicative bidding, a bid adjustment technique used by many search engines. They also study the complexity of approximating the solution and give algorithms under various assumptions.

\[[5](http://www.scu.edu/business/economics/upload/YellowPad-TomBlake.pdf)\] **Why Marketplace Experimentation is Harder than it Seems: The Role of Test-Control Interference,** Dominic Coey and Thomas Blake

Discusses role of and conditions for test-control (A/B) interference in determining the effectiveness of marketplace campaigns

\[[6](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2750v2.pdf)\] **Incentivized Optimal Advert Assignment via Utility Decomposition,** Frank Kelly, Peter Key and Neil Walton

Kelly extends his primal-dual optimization framework (originally introduced for communication networks) to formulate a network utility maximization framework for platform and advertisers together. The mechanism introduced is also incentive compatible.

\[[7](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6249v2.pdf)\] **The Complexity of Fairness through Equilibrium,** Abraham Othman, Christos Papadimitriou and Aviad Rubinstein

Discusses the complexity of approximating Competitive Equilibrium with Equal Income (CEEI, a particular market clearing mechanism that offers efficiency, feasibility and fairness. In short, approximating CEEI in general is hard.

\[[8](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2625v1.pdf)\] **Asymptotically Truthful Equilibrium Selection in Large Congestion Games,** Ryan Rogers and Aaron Roth

For congestion games with large number of players and incomplete information, this paper introduces mechanism that guarantees a Nash equilibrium improving on previous mechanisms that could only guarantee correlated equilibrium.

\[[9](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nkshah/papers/euclidean_voting.ec14.pdf)\] **Neutrality and Geometry of Mean Voting,** Sébastien Lahaie and Nisarg Shah

Integrates the neutrality axiom into mean proximity framework for voting to achieve consensus amongst agents, and shows that the new axiom allows a more compact representation for every mean proximity rule.
