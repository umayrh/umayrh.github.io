Cooking involves measurement of units of solids, liquids, or gases; and their inter-mixing. This post is 
somehow inspired by the article, [Preserve or Perish](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsnr.2019.0004), 
which may be summarized: 
* What to preserve? "[F]ruits such as cherries, apricots and quinces; nuts such as walnuts and almonds; meat 
  that might be salted, dried or potted; flowers such as candied roses; and vegetables such as pickled cucumbers..."
* And taxidermy? "[T]axidermists used pepper and tobacco dust to preserve animal hides, while small animals were 
  bottled up in jars of alcohol, much like the pickled cucumbers of recipe books."
* What in knowledge remains tacit? "...highlight the value of reconstructions in the history of science and 
  technology and their ability to recover ‘lost’ knowledge"
* "Often the quantities of water and salt were not indicated in the recipes... The vessel was also not specified"

#### Amounts
The [Folger Manuscript V.b.400](https://emroc.hypotheses.org/ongoing-projects/the-folger-manuscript-v-b-400-project) 
creates a pharmaceutical shorthand for recipe amounts.
