<p>1. The max.allowed.packet size limits the size of query packet from client. It may be specified at both client and server side. JDBC clients may need to pass “sessionVariables=maxAllowedPacket=…” during connection setup since the driver may not support changing session properties once the session has been established.See also <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/packet-too-large.html">this post</a>. On server side, “<strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql --max_allowed_packet=32M</code></strong>” to set the property and “show variables like ‘max_allowed_packet” to query it.</p>

<p>Note that max allowed packet property is distinct from the fetch size property, which limits the number of rows fetched from the database.</p>
