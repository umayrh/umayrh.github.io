<p>[<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5758v1.pdf">1</a>] <strong>Bandits with concave rewards and convex knapsacks,</strong> Shipra Agrawal and Nikhil R. Devanur</p>

<p>Introduces and gives polynomial-time near-optimal algorithms for a general model for bandit exploration-exploitation. The algorithm is an extension of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for the multi-armed bandits problem. The new framework allows them to give more efficient algorithms for other problems such as Blackwell approachability, online convex optimization and conditional-gradient/projection-free/Frank-Wolfe algorithm.</p>

<p>Shows that in decentralized two-sided markets with asynchronous arrivals and departures and no information about seller availability, limited seller visibility can improve general welfare.</p>

<p>Optimizes linear combinations of the utilities of competing stakeholders (auctioneer, user, advertiser) in ad auctions using a generalized second-price (GSP) auction with per-click reserve prices.</p>

<p>Establishes the optimization problem behind multiplicative bidding, a bid adjustment technique used by many search engines. They also study the complexity of approximating the solution and give algorithms under various assumptions.</p>

<p>Discusses role of and conditions for test-control (A/B) interference in determining the effectiveness of marketplace campaigns</p>

<p>[<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2750v2.pdf">6</a>] <strong>Incentivized Optimal Advert Assignment via Utility Decomposition,</strong> Frank Kelly, Peter Key and Neil Walton</p>

<p>Kelly extends his primal-dual optimization framework (originally introduced for communication networks) to formulate a network utility maximization framework for platform and advertisers together. The mechanism introduced is also incentive compatible.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6249v2.pdf">7</a>] <strong>The Complexity of Fairness through Equilibrium,</strong> Abraham Othman, Christos Papadimitriou and Aviad Rubinstein</p>

<p>Discusses the complexity of approximating Competitive Equilibrium with Equal Income (CEEI, a particular market clearing mechanism that offers efficiency, feasibility and fairness. In short, approximating CEEI in general is hard.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2625v1.pdf">8</a>] <strong>Asymptotically Truthful Equilibrium Selection in Large Congestion Games,</strong> Ryan Rogers and Aaron Roth</p>

<p>For congestion games with large number of players and incomplete information, this paper introduces mechanism that guarantees a Nash equilibrium improving on previous mechanisms that could only guarantee correlated equilibrium.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nkshah/papers/euclidean_voting.ec14.pdf">9</a>] <strong>Neutrality and Geometry of Mean Voting,</strong> Sébastien Lahaie and Nisarg Shah</p>

<p>Integrates the neutrality axiom into mean proximity framework for voting to achieve consensus amongst agents, and shows that the new axiom allows a more compact representation for every mean proximity rule.</p>
