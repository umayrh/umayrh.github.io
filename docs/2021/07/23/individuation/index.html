Image courtesy of <a href="https://fyfluiddynamics.com/2020/08/crystalline-critters/">FYFD</a>.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Philosophy often focuses on existence and essence while individual beings only serve as the apparent evidence of a different reality. Simondon, returning philosophy‚Äôs focus to the process of an individual‚Äôs formation, says that what is implicit here is the assumption that there is a ‚Äúprinciple of individuation prior to individuation itself that is capable of explaining, producing, and guiding it.‚Äù Perhaps what makes his new focus unique is his refusal to ‚Äúgrant an ontological privilege to the constituted individual.‚Äù And so Simondon begins with two postulates:</p><ul><li>Individuation has a principle</li><li>Individuation explains the individual, and not vice versa.</li></ul><p>By page 2, Simondon deems philosophy - atomism and hylomorphism, in particular - to have inadequately described individuation. By page 5, Simondon lays out what makes his thesis possible: ‚ÄúIndividuation has not been able to be adequately thought and described because only a single form of equilibrium was known, namely stable equilibrium; what was unknown was precisely metastable equilibrium.‚Äù It is as if Simondon is announcing a new relationship of philosophy with natural sciences, physics and biology, in particular. And so Simondon folds into philosophy concepts from thermodynamics like:</p><ul><li>system</li><li>potential energy</li><li>phase</li><li>equilibrium (stable, metastable)</li></ul><p>And, at least, in the first half of the book, his examples focus on:</p><ul><li>crystallization</li><li>boiling and condensation</li><li>rain, clouds, and snow</li></ul><p>Though the phenomena also spans protein formation, semiconductor development, and alloy design. In other words, nucleation pervades nature as well as technology.</p><p>‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶we supposed that individuation doesn‚Äôt just produce the individual, we would not seek to pass quickly through the stage of individuation to arrive at this ultimate reality that the individual is‚Ä¶‚Äù (pg. 3)</p><p>The principle of individuation is:</p><ul><li>Analytical: it is genesis - ontogenesis - in reverse,</li><li>Explanatory: it accounts for an individual‚Äôs <em>haecceity</em>: what makes an individual unique,</li><li>Primordial, in its operation:<ul><li>‚ÄúThe individual‚Ä¶a relative reality‚Ä¶ does not fully exist by itself‚Äù</li><li>‚Äú‚Ä¶individuation does not fully exhaust in a single stroke the potentials of pre-individual reality‚Äù</li></ul></li></ul><p>And so individuation can be redefined without reference to the individual: ‚Äúa partial and relative resolution that manifests in a system which contains potentials and includes a certain incompatibility with respect to itself, an incompatibility that consists of forces of tension and the impossibility of an interaction between the extreme terms of the dimensions.‚Äù In other words, the essential aspect is not the coherence of the individual but the persistence of potentials in a system.</p><p>This lead to a redefinition of ontogenesis - not in terms of the constituted individual - but as a relationship of being and phase-shifting, a re-consideration of being, and a revaluation of the logic of being:</p><ul><li>‚ÄúBecoming is a dimension of being, and corresponds to the being‚Äôs capacity to phase shift‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúPre-individual being is being in which no phase exists‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúIndividuation corresponds to the appearance of phases in the being that are the phases of the being.‚Äù</li><li>‚Äúwe must consider being not as substance or matter or form but as a tense, supersaturated system above the level of unity‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúUnity, which is characteristic of the individual being, and identity, which authorizes the usage of the principle of the excluded middle, do not apply to pre-individual being‚Äù</li></ul><h4 id="media">Media</h4><ul><li>Wenting Zhu, <a href="https://vimeo.com/333319621">Salt crystallization in the Arctic.</a></li><li><a href="https://fyfluiddynamics.com/category/fyfd-video/">FYFD Videos</a></li><li><a href="https://gfm.aps.org/">APS Gallery of Fluid Motion</a></li><li><a href="https://gfm.aps.org/meetings/dfd-2023/649b3ad8199e4c137897831b">The hydrodynamics of marbling art</a></li><li><a href="https://benton.uconn.edu/clouds-a-collaboration-with-fluid-dynamics/">Clouds: A Collaboration with Fluid Dynamics</a></li><li><a href="http://sun-yue.com/art-animation/paper-marbling/">Paper marbling</a></li><li></li></ul><h4 id="references">References</h4><ol><li>S.

Jeon et al. observed the formation of gold crystals on a graphene substrate through the reduction of a precursor using an electron beam. Rather than the classic view, they instead observed a nucleation pathway that involves dynamic and reversible fluctuations of developing nuclei between disordered and crystalline states.‚Äù [1]</li><li>‚Äú‚Ä¶organisms are able to control the location and crystallographic orientation of nucleation, the shape of the growing crystallites, and even the phase of the resulting material.‚Äù [2]</li><li>‚ÄúHow can the gas molecules ‚Äúknow‚Äù when they have to coagulate to form a liquid or solid?‚Äù [9]</li><li>‚ÄúIf the expansion be slow, the supersaturation can nowhere greatly exceed that required for the formation of the first drops. With very sudden expansions, however, even if they be much greater than that required to produce rain-like condensation, the drops which are the first to begin to form will not have time to grow sensibly before the expansion is completed, and their influence on the temperature and vapour contents of the air will be confined to a very small region round each.‚Äù [8]</li><li>‚ÄúThe key new idea [8,11] developed by BCF is that real solids are generally not perfectly crystalline, but contain dislocations, and in particular the intersection of a screw dislocation with a surface leads to the presence of a single molecular layer step (figure 2) that can never saturate; it allows growth of layers around the point of intersection of the dislocation and the surface without ever growing out of the crystal, like laying a carpet up a spiral staircase.‚Äù [11]</li><li>‚ÄúThe overwhelming majority of crystals growing from supercooled melts and supersaturated solutions are dendritic (tree-like) structures that have a main trunk and side branches located at some distance from the vertex‚Äù [12]</li><li>‚Äúit has become possible to explain the origin and selection of surface structures from planar to cellular, dendritic, and fractal patterns. The Mullins‚ÄìSekerka (MS) morphological instability theory provides a condition for stability or reconstruction of interfaces, which separates the phases during phase transformation.‚Äù [13]</li><li>‚ÄúFragmentation is a multistage process. (A) High-speed images show first fracture (Movie S1). A crack nucleates and grows initially on a relatively slow millisecond timescale. Catastrophic failure occurs at a critical crack depth (the Griffith length) leading to rapid crack propagation.‚Äù [16]</li><li>‚ÄúAccording to classical nucleation theory, a nucleus from which crystals grow forms in a single, spontaneous step. In this work, we combine ultralow-dose in situ liquid-phase and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy to show that metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs) nucleate through a different, nonclassical pathway with three distinct steps. These steps are phase separation, condensation, and crystallization.‚Äù [17]</li></ul><h5 id="self-organization">Self-organization</h5><ul><li>‚Äú‚Ä¶self-organization therefore typically occurs in non-equilibrium or dissipative systems. Cells, with their constant energy consumption and myriads of local interactions between distinct proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, represent the perfect playground for self-organization. It therefore comes as no surprise that many properties and features of self-organized systems, such as spontaneous formation of patterns, nonlinear coupling of reactions, bi-stable switches, waves and oscillations, are found in all aspects of modern cell biology. Ultimately, self-organization lies at the heart or the robustness and adaptability found in cellular and organismal organization, and hence constitutes a fundamental basis for natural selection and evolution.‚Äù [14]</li><li>‚ÄúA realization of the inability to equilibrate to a common structure (3, 4) and the ensemble nature of partially folded forms led the theoretical community to a very different more statistical ‚Äúnew view‚Äù (7‚Äì11). It was inferred that proteins must fold to their unique native state through multiple unpredictable routes and intermediate conformations.‚Äù [15]</li><li></li></ul><h5 id="conception">Conception</h5><ul><li>‚ÄúThe maternal‚Äìfetal interface (MFI) has long been considered an evolutionarily unresolved frontier of genetic conflict owing to the genetic distinctness of the two sides of the interface. This unresolved conflict has resulted in a diverse biological landscape of solutions‚Äù <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2323038122">pdf</a></li><li>‚ÄúThe instability at the origin of the universe is the result of fluctuations of the vacuum in which black holes act as membranes that stabilize these fluctuations. In short, black holes will be produced by and ‚Äúinverse‚Äù Hawking radiation process and, once formed, will decompose into ‚Äúreal‚Äù matter through the usual Hawking radiation. In this way, the irreversible transformation of space-time into matter can be described as a phase separation between matter and gravitation in which black holes play the role of ‚Äúcritical nuclei.‚Äù‚Äù [18]</li><li></li></ul></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=Process and reality in individuation+http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/+by+Umayr Hassan" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=Process and reality in individuation&summary=&url=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-tumblr"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=http://localhost:4000/assets/images/crystallization.gif&url=http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://umayrh.github.io" title="More By Umayr Hassan">Umayr Hassan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/individuation/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/crystallization.gif" alt="Process and reality in individuation"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Process and reality in individuation</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/23/the-species-problem/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/the-species-problem.png" alt="The Species Problem"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">The Species Problem</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="subscribe" id="subscribe"><div class="subscribe__container"> <span class="subscribe__title">Subscribe</span><p class="subscribe__text">Get a weekly email of posts I‚Äôve added to the site.</p><form method="POST" action="&amp;c=?" id="mc-signup" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate><div style="position: absolute;
