<p>While exploring ways to estimate multiset union and intersection cardinalities, I discovered an interesting result mentioned in a paper by Shukla [1], who in turn cites Feller [2]: If r elements are chosen uniformly and at random from a set of n elements, the expected number of distinct elements obtained is</p>

<p>$latex n - n (1 - 1/n)^r$.</p>

<p>Given an element <em>a</em> from the set, the probability that there are none of the elements after r draws is <em>a</em> is $latex (1 - 1/n)^r$. Thus the probability that there is at least one element is <em>a</em> (or equivalently that there is at least one unique item) is $latex 1 - (1 - 1/n)^r$, and hence the expected number of uniques is $latex n - n (1 - 1/n)^r$. Alternatively, as Feller explains, the probability of a single unique at the ith step is $latex ((1 - 1/n)/n)^{i-1}$, hence the expected number of uniques after r draws is</p>

<p> $latex \sum_{i=1}^{r} ((1 - 1/n)/n)^{i-1}$</p>

<p>A geometric series that converges to $latex n - n (1 - 1/n)^r$.</p>

<p>This is an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday problem</a>. <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/72223/finding-expected-number-of-distinct-values-selected-from-a-set-of-integers">Stackexchange</a> has a couple of other more complicated but interesting solutions.</p>
